# Applications of Elliptic Curves to Fermat's Last Theorem
**Directed Reading Program 2022, by Elise Alvarez-Salazar, Caroline Baldan, and Kelly Stump**

For our project, we studied methods of finding rational solutions on elliptic curves. We then used the abelian group structure observed to show a special case of Fermat's Last Theorem, proving that there are no non-trivial solutions to a<sup>4</sup>+b<sup>4</sup>=c<sup>4</sup>.
