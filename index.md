For our project, we studied methods of finding rational solutions on elliptic curves. We then used the rich group structure observed over the curve to show a special case of Fermat's Last Theorem, proving that there are no non-trivial solutions to a<sup>4</sup>+b<sup>4</sup>=c<sup>4</sup>.

### Algorithm
Click [here](https://replit.com/@MarcosReyes6/Elliptic-Curve-Fun?outputonly=1&lite=true#main.py) to input your own non-singular elliptic curve. Our algorithm will compute the set of torsion points and tell you the group structure of the torsion set for the elliptic curve you submitted.

This algorithm relys primarily on the Nagell-Lutz Theorum, as well as Mazur's Theorum and the operation defined to create the abelian group.

This image shows the operation defined on our poster when used to add a point to itself, rather than adding two points together. All the steps of the operation remain the same, however the tangent line at the point P is used, instead of the secant line intersecting the points P and Q.

This image displays the graph of a<sup>4</sup>+b<sup>4</sup>=c<sup>4</sup>, the elliptic curve used defined in Fermat's Last Theorem for n=4. The equation that you see in the top right corner of the graph is that same curve in Weierstrass form. To see how the group structure of this curve can be used to show that it has no non-trivial solutions, see our poster (linked above).
